- [x] Graphs - DFS, BFS
- [x] Divide and Conquer
- [x] Greedy Algorithms
- [ ] Dynaminc programming // no yet :worried:
- [x] Ad-hoc
- [x] Sorting
- [x] Binary Tree
- [x] Binary search


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I like to study programming fundamentals and try to apply them to problems, for that I use some sites, like leetcode, open kattis and others. The purpose of this roadmap of studies and problem solving is to interview codes from large companies and participate in programming marathons.

Sites:
* [LeetCode]](https://leetcode.com)
* [Open Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/)
* [Online jugde UVA](https://onlinejudge.org/)


## Tools

- [x] C++ language 
- [x] Linux
- [x] Windows
- [x] Python
- [x] Time Complexity
- [x] Vscode
- [x] Geani editor

### Prerequisites

For competitions, the preferred language is c++, as I use linux, I just give the command
* C++ e C
  ```sh
  $ sudo apt install build-essential
  ```
For code interviews, as time is short, some people recommend using python, but if you want to use another language, feel free.

How to run your code?
* In terminal use, for c++: 
``` sh
    g++ -Wall -std=c++17 "main.cpp" -o "main"
```
For python use:
```sh
    python3 "file.py"
```
